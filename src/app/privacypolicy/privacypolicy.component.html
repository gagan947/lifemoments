                <h4 class="ct_fs_20">APP PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
<p>At Life’s Moments, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy and maintaining the confidentiality of any personal information you provide to us. We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) as always set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) at all times.</p>

<p>The personal information we collect is used solely to enhance and deliver our services to you effectively. We are dedicated to managing your information responsibly, lawfully, and transparently.</p>

<p>Please read our Privacy Policy below for detailed information on how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal data.</p>

<h4 class="ct_fs_20">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h4>
<p>In the course of providing our services, we may obtain the following information about you: name, company name, email address, telephone number, credit card details, billing address, geographic location, IP address, survey responses, support queries, blog comments and social media handles (together ‘Personal Data’).</p>

<p>Our services are not directed to persons under 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are the parent or guardian of a child and you believe they have provided us with Personal Data without your consent, then please contact us.</p>

<p>You can review, correct, update or delete your Personal Data by either logging into your account and making the changes yourself or contacting us directly to do so.</p>

<h4 class="ct_fs_20">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We use the information we collect to deliver our services to you, including: communicating with you, providing technical support, notifying you of updates and offers, sharing useful content, measuring customer satisfaction, diagnosing problems and providing you with a more personalised experience.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We also use the information we collect in aggregated and anonymised forms to improve our services, including: producing reports and analytics, advertising our products and services, identifying user demands and assisting in meeting customer needs generally.</p>

<p>You hereby agree that, subject to this Privacy Policy and Australian Privacy legislation, we may collect, monitor, review, analyse, use, share or sell to third parties’ non-personally identifiable data or information we collect from your use of the App or associated services.</p>


<h4 class="ct_fs_20">STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We will use all reasonable means to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Data while in our possession or control. All information we receive from you is stored and protected on our secure servers to prevent unauthorised use or access. Credit card information is encrypted before transmission and is not stored by us.</p>

<p>To enable us to deliver our services, we may transfer information that we collect about you, including Personal Data, across borders for storage and processing in countries other than Australia. If your Personal Data is transferred and processed outside Australia, it will only be transferred to countries that have adequate privacy protections.</p>

<p>We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide services to you and as required to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We periodically purge the database to ensure any outdated information that may personally identify you is wiped from our database.</p>

<p>In the event of a breach of our security and your Personal Data is compromised, we will promptly notify you in compliance with applicable law.</p>

<h4 class="ct_fs_20">APP TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES (Cookies and Pixels Equivalent)</h4>
<p>Our mobile application may use tracking technologies, including software development kits (SDKs), local storage, and device identifiers, which serve a similar function to cookies and pixels on websites. These technologies collect data about your usage patterns, preferences, and interactions within the App to help us enhance your user experience.</p>

<p>These tools do not access Personal Data stored on your device, such as your name, address, or contact details unless you explicitly provide that information through the App.</p>

<p>We use these technologies to: analyse in-app behaviour and usage statistics, personalise your experience and improve app functionality, enable features such as social media sharing, and serve relevant ads via third-party platforms such as Google Ads or Meta (Facebook/Instagram), which may display ads within our app or in other apps and websites you visit.</p>

<p>You can manage tracking settings via your device or app settings. However, disabling these functions may impact the performance or usability of certain app features.</p>

<h4 class="ct_fs_20">SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h4>
<p>We do not and will not sell or deal in Personal Data or any Personal customer information.</p>

<p>Your Personal Data details are only disclosed to third-party suppliers when it is required by law, for goods or services that you have purchased, for payment processing, or to protect our copyright, trademarks and other legal rights. To the extent that we do share your Personal Data with a service provider, we would only do so if that party has agreed to comply with our privacy standards as described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable law. Our contracts with third parties prohibit them from using any of your Personal Data for any purpose other than that for which it was shared.</p>

<h4 class="ct_fs_20">DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We may, from time to time, need to disclose certain information, which may include your Personal Data, to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, or warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding, or in response to a request from a law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may use your Personal Data to protect the rights, property, or safety of Life’s Moments, our customers, or third parties.</p>

<p>If there is a change of control in one of our businesses (whether by merger, sale, transfer of assets or otherwise), customer information, which may include your Personal Data, could be transferred to a purchaser under a confidentiality agreement. We would only disclose your Personal Data in good faith and where required by any of the above circumstances.</p>

We encourage our users to be aware, when they leave our website, to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
